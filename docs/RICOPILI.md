The following scripts are adapted from ricopili (https://github.com/Nealelab/ricopili) with very minor changes:

* `buigue_pico.pl`, from `buigue`
* `checkflip_pico.pl`, from `checkflip4`
* `checkpos_pico.pl`, from `checkpos6`
* `config`, from `rp_config`
* `lift_to_hg19.pl`, from `lift18219`
* `plague_pico.pl`, from `plague_2`
* `./rp_perl/Utils.pm`, from `./Ricopili/Utils.pm`

In addition, the following scripts are adapted from ricopili with more substantial changes as indicated:

* `imp_prep.pl`: adapted from `impute_dirsub_[version]`, extracting only the initial steps for build guessing, and matching position/alleles to the imputation reference.
* `readref_pico.pl`: adapted from `my.readref`, providing more flexibility on specifying the format of the reference information file.
